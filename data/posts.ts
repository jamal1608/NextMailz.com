Every time you sign up for a service, subscribe to a newsletter, or create an account, you're potentially exposing yourself to spam, data breaches, and privacy violations. A temporary email (also called disposable email, throwaway email, or 10-minute email) is a short-lived email address that self-destructs after a set period—usually 10 minutes. It allows you to receive emails without using your real email address."
